# House Price Prediction

In this project, we used some algorithm to predict the house price for boston housing datasets. Main goal is to compare various algorithms and evaluate models by comparing prediction accuracy. We examined different models -  Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and RidgeRegression  based on the accuracy (MSE) .

# Algorithms Used

<li>Linear Regression</li>
<li>Ridge Regression</li>
<li>Lasso Regression</li>


# conclusion
We have compared algorithms by MSE. We found that Lasso model gave lowest MSE.
