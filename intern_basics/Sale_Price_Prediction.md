**SALE PRICE PREDICTION**
# STATEMENT:
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this 
playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence. With 79 explanatory variables 
describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this challenges to predict the final price of each home.

# GOAL:
To predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, predict the value of the SalePrice variable.
